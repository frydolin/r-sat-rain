###### SATELLITE PRECIPITATION ESTIMATES â€“ ASSESSING FEASABILITY FOR KAPUAS CATCHMENT ######

## run.R executes the analysis ##

# Maybe you need to set the correct correct wd: set.wd() or adjust file path

source("scripts/read.R") 	          ## loads in all the data and converts to appropriate formats ##

# PART 1: Point to pixel comparison
source("scripts/extract_values.R")  ## extracts values of station positions and makes time series##
source("scripts/aggregate.R")	      ## creates all necessary summaries and variables to be analysed ##
source("scripts/compare.R")         ## plots comparative summaries to output 

# PART 2: spatial comparison
source("scripts/spatial_aggregate.R")  ## spatially subsets and aggregates data
source("scripts/spatial_compare.R")  ## compares spatially aggregated data and interpolation results
